Welcome to my personal website!<br><br>I honestly have no idea. I just made this site because I felt like it. Maybe one day it'll become something great, but for now it's my personal space to blog, vlog or do PSAs, though it'll most likely end up as a file dump.<br><br>This site was made with <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_self" rel="noopener" class="is-unresolved">Obsidian</a>, yes the notes taking app. There's a great plugin called the <a href="https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export" target="_self" rel="noopener" class="is-unresolved">Webpage HTML Export</a> which helps me export it without a hiccup. It is then uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/WinnerWind/winnerwind.github.io" target="_self" rel="noopener" class="is-unresolved">My personal Github repository</a> using Github Desktop. Really, it works without a hiccup, and its a great workflow for people who don't know the first thing about HTML, like me.<br>]]></description><link>https://winnerwind.github.io/index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">index.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[WinnerWind]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 16:25:25 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
