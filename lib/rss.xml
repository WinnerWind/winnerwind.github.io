Completely fluent and comfortable to talk, write and read English. Feel free to contact me in English (In fact, I'd appreciate it!)<br><br><br>
I can speak in Hindi however I struggle to read or comprehend more descriptive or complex sentences.<br><br><br>
I am more comfortable to speak in Bengali compared to Hindi however I cannot read Bengali at all.<br><br><br>
I am currently learning Japanese as a hobby. I am unable to speak Japanese, nor understand it through audio. I need a dictionary or a translator to fully understand what you might be saying.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="index" data-href="index" href="https://winnerwind.github.io/index.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Home</a>]]></description><link>https://winnerwind.github.io/contact.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Contact.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[WinnerWind]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 05:35:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Songs I like right now]]></title><description><![CDATA[<br>If you can't see anything, just give Spotify a moment to load in all the i-frames.<br> <br>I swear I'm not Japanese]]></description><link>https://winnerwind.github.io/music/songs.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Music/Songs.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[WinnerWind]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 06:32:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Playlists I like right now]]></title><description><![CDATA[<br>If you can't see anything, just give Spotify a moment to load in all the i-frames.<br> more coming soon]]></description><link>https://winnerwind.github.io/music/playlists.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Music/Playlists.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[WinnerWind]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 06:32:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Home]]></title><description><![CDATA[<br><br>Hi, I am WinnerWind.

WORK IN PROGRESS SITE<br><br>I honestly have no idea. I just made this site because I felt like it. Maybe one day it'll become something great, but for now it's my personal space to blog, vlog or do PSAs, though it'll most likely end up as a file dump.<br><br>This site was made with <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_self" rel="noopener" class="is-unresolved">Obsidian</a>, yes the notes taking app. There's a great plugin called the <a href="https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export" target="_self" rel="noopener" class="is-unresolved">Webpage HTML Export</a> which helps me export it without a hiccup. It is then uploaded to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/WinnerWind/winnerwind.github.io" rel="noopener" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/WinnerWind/winnerwind.github.io" target="_self">My personal Github repository</a> using Github Desktop.

When approaching language learning, it's easy to be intimidated or lead down the wrong path. This loop, which is a generalised implementation of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://morg.systems/58465ab9.html" rel="noopener" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://morg.systems/58465ab9.html" target="_self">Morg's Loop for Japanese</a> hopes to make language learning easy and fun.<br>
This is a guideline and not a syllabus. There is no syllabus to being fluent in any language.<br>
Also note that I am mostly a monolingual with some knowledge in Hindi, Bengali and Japanese. I am in no way qualified to give such generalised advice. This is just what has worked best for me to get my language proficiency to where I am now.<br> loop <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="loop.canvas" data-href="loop.canvas" href="https://winnerwind.github.io/!-resources/loop.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">View Contents</a> <br><br>The decision to start learning is the strongest one. However, it is also important to do it efficiently.<br>
If the language you are learning has its own script, it is worth learning that script. Don't focus on perfection, just have a decent idea of what each letter sounds like.<br>
You will need to learn some basic grammar before you can start the soul of the loop. Although in theory you could skip this step, it will cause you to have many doubts and questions. Optionally pick up a grammar deck or a vocabulary deck. Check out Anki for this. It is a free, open source flashcards app that has helped me memorise thousands of words in mere months.<br>
