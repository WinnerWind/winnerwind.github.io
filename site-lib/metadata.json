In case you have not accessed it before, it will be marked with a blue dot.\nNavigate to the \"3D Audio for Headphones\" tab.\nEnable 3D Audio For Headphones\nGo to \"Create Personalised 3D Audio Profile\"\nYou'll be given a practice round first. Be sure to read the instructions well. After that, you'll be given 7 sets of these. These are actually used for calibration.\nThe entire calibration is done through a game-like experience. You do get a practice round just to get the hang of the game. For one exercise, you get a graphic on the screen and must move the digital speakers around this ball to represent from where you are hearing the sound. Another exercise is to pick the angle through which you hear the sound going through. Each set contains two of the ball exercise, and two of the angle exercise. In total there are 7 sets, and the on screen visuals are eye candy, that's for sure.Both exercises suffer from the problem that they're really eye and ear candy, which makes calibrating tough. Like, for the angle exercise, the sound that is played has so much noise that discerning the angle is really tough, especially when the slices are not that far apart. The sphere exercise's visual is really vague and it's hard to tell whether the digital speaker is in front of you or behind you. All in all, it's good, but its not perfect.Also, each sound can only be played twice, which is something that definitely needs to be fixed. Twice is simply not enough to discern the position, unless you really pay attention and have FPS level hearing. I quite like the way the calibration is done, despite it's flaws. I have used a lot of calibration tools, not just for 3D Audio, but also for headphone specific modifications, and none of them have been as fun and simple as this one. Fun isn't the right word, it does become a bit boring after a bit, but still, It's a lot better than some of the other alternatives I have tried, like SoundEQ and SoundID, what I consider to be gold standards for audio calibration. The accuracy is still a bit iffy, and I have noticed that in some games it can make the gunfire and comms chat sound as if they're in different locations from where they actually are (Eg. being further or closer from the player, being too much to the left or too much to the right, or being completely centered despite being on the right). However, after a few more calibrations, it sounds alright.Somehow, the new 3D Audio system works in games that don't really support 3D audio, like Persona 5 Strikers. Sure, it's not like magically stereo becomes 7.1, but the music sounds richer in that game with 3D Audio enabled. Not sure what that's about.All in all, I quite like the new update. It's far from perfect, but it's already quite nice, and I will admit, the \"game\" is fun, despite it's shortcomings. I look forward to see how PlayStation develops this feature.\n<a href=\"https://winnerwind.github.io?query=tag:Blogs/Review\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Blogs/Review\">#Blogs/Review</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"How to Access","level":1,"id":"How_to_Access_0"},{"heading":"Review","level":1,"id":"Review_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:Blogs/Review"],"author":"WinnerWind","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://winnerwind.github.io/blogs/reviews/ps5-3d-for-headphones.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1727441338188,"modifiedTime":1727437600745,"sourceSize":3151,"sourcePath":"Blogs/Reviews/PS5 3D For Headphones.md","exportPath":"blogs/reviews/ps5-3d-for-headphones.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"blogs/tutorials/linux/firewall.html":{"title":"Firewall","icon":"","description":"While it is not needed, it's good to have.

YAY can also replace pacman as it can pull packages from there too. In fact, YAY automates the process we just did! You can search for packages using yay &lt;search term&gt;. You can include multiple search terms by adding spaces such as yay foo bar It will ask you for the number of the packages you want to install. You can include multiple numbers by adding spaces.

You can install any package directly by running yay -S &lt;package name&gt;, like in pacman. You can pass multiple package names by separating them with a space\nYou can remove any package by running yay -R &lt;package name&gt;. You can pass multiple package names by separating them with a space\nYou can remove any package along with all it's dependencies (to save space) using yay -Rs &lt;package name&gt;.

Don't put any package names here.\nThis is optional reading material.\nPacman is a very special package manager which allows front-ends to be written for it.

Alternately, in ibus-setup, under the Input Method tab, you can click preferences when Mozc is selected to see more settings. You can also theme it in ibus-setup\nFCITX5 is admittedly easier to install than IBUS, and does not need long compile times as it is mostly pre-compiled. It also runs like a traditional IME, and sits in your system tray, so it does not need you to add a separate, virtual keyboard layout.\nInstall FCITX5 by installing fcitx5-im. Be sure to get every member in it's group, as it comes in handy.\nInstall the backend by installing fcitx5-mozc.\nAdd this to your /etc/environment Use sudo\nGTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx\nQT_IM_MODULE=fcitx\nXMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx Restart your computer.\nIf you're in KDE Plasma, an option called \"Input Methods\" or \"FCITX\" may appear as a tab within the settings. It has a penguin logo. You can add MOZC there by selecting it from the right pane and adding it into the left pane. (If you don't have KDE Plasma, an app called FCITX 5 Configtool should appear as a standalone app)<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20240622185215.png\" src=\"https://winnerwind.github.io/!-resources/photo_dump/linux/arch-linux/pasted-image-20240622185215.png\" target=\"_self\">\nModify keybind settings in the \"Global Options\" tab. Modify MOZC settings and theme settings in the \"Addons\" tab.

I don't even know why. I keep telling myself, \"Just a few more days, and you'll be free\", but it feels as though I am running on a treadmill, and even though I know that time will pass, whether I do absolutely nothing or absolutely everything at the same time, a part of me believes that time is truly affixed in one place, that no matter what I do, nothing ever happens.
