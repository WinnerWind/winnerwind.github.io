In case you have not accessed it before, it will be marked with a blue dot.\nNavigate to the \"3D Audio for Headphones\" tab.\nEnable 3D Audio For Headphones\nGo to \"Create Personalised 3D Audio Profile\"\nYou'll be given a practice round first. Be sure to read the instructions well. After that, you'll be given 7 sets of these. These are actually used for calibration.\nThe entire calibration is done through a game-like experience. You do get a practice round just to get the hang of the game. For one exercise, you get a graphic on the screen and must move the digital speakers around this ball to represent from where you are hearing the sound. Another exercise is to pick the angle through which you hear the sound going through. Each set contains two of the ball exercise, and two of the angle exercise. In total there are 7 sets, and the on screen visuals are eye candy, that's for sure.Both exercises suffer from the problem that they're really eye and ear candy, which makes calibrating tough. Like, for the angle exercise, the sound that is played has so much noise that discerning the angle is really tough, especially when the slices are not that far apart. The sphere exercise's visual is really vague and it's hard to tell whether the digital speaker is in front of you or behind you. All in all, it's good, but its not perfect.Also, each sound can only be played twice, which is something that definitely needs to be fixed. Twice is simply not enough to discern the position, unless you really pay attention and have FPS level hearing. I quite like the way the calibration is done, despite it's flaws. I have used a lot of calibration tools, not just for 3D Audio, but also for headphone specific modifications, and none of them have been as fun and simple as this one. Fun isn't the right word, it does become a bit boring after a bit, but still, It's a lot better than some of the other alternatives I have tried, like SoundEQ and SoundID, what I consider to be gold standards for audio calibration. The accuracy is still a bit iffy, and I have noticed that in some games it can make the gunfire and comms chat sound as if they're in different locations from where they actually are (Eg. being further or closer from the player, being too much to the left or too much to the right, or being completely centered despite being on the right). However, after a few more calibrations, it sounds alright.Somehow, the new 3D Audio system works in games that don't really support 3D audio, like Persona 5 Strikers. Sure, it's not like magically stereo becomes 7.1, but the music sounds richer in that game with 3D Audio enabled. Not sure what that's about.All in all, I quite like the new update. It's far from perfect, but it's already quite nice, and I will admit, the \"game\" is fun, despite it's shortcomings. I look forward to see how PlayStation develops this feature.\n<a href=\".?query=tag:Blogs/Review\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"#Blogs/Review\">#Blogs/Review</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":["#Blogs/Review"],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"PS5 3D For Headphones","level":1,"id":"PS5 3D For Headphones"},{"heading":"How to Access","level":1,"id":"How_to_Access"},{"heading":"Review","level":1,"id":"Review"}],"links":["?query=tag:Blogs/Review"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"blog-dump/reviews/ps5-3d-for-headphones.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1727441338188,"modifiedTime":1727437600745,"sourceSize":3151,"sourcePath":"Blog Dump/Reviews/PS5 3D For Headphones.md","exportPath":"blog-dump/reviews/ps5-3d-for-headphones.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"blog-dump/tutorials/linux/learn-linux/!-cheat-sheet.html":{"title":"! - Cheat Sheet","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"! - Cheat Sheet","level":1,"id":"! - Cheat Sheet"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"blog-dump/tutorials/linux/learn-linux/!-cheat-sheet.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1724296206243,"modifiedTime":1721739267432,"sourceSize":0,"sourcePath":"Blog Dump/Tutorials/Linux/Learn Linux/! - Cheat Sheet.md","exportPath":"blog-dump/tutorials/linux/learn-linux/!-cheat-sheet.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"blog-dump/tutorials/linux/learn-linux/chapter-1.html":{"title":"Learn to Linux - 1","icon":"","description":"Ever wanted to learn Linux?

This is not needed, but prevents clutter in your home directory.\nRun sudo pacman -S git base-devel to install some packages to compile YAY.\nMove to the directory aur by running cd aur.\nRun git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git to clone a copy of YAY.\nOnce it's done, run cd yay\nRun makepkg -si to make the package and install it in one go.\nInstall YAY.\nYou can now use YAY to install any package from the AUR and compile it automatically. YAY can also replace pacman as it can pull packages from there too. In fact, YAY automates the process we just did! You can search for packages using yay &lt;search term&gt;. You can include multiple search terms by adding spaces such as yay foo bar It will ask you for the number of the packages you want to install. You can include multiple numbers by adding spaces. Do N for Clean Build unless the previous try using YAY halted unexpectedly or got corrupt.\nDo N for Show Diffs unless you want to read the licence agreement.\nDo N for Remove Make Dependencies unless you want to install them every time you want to compile a package (why would you want to do that?)\nIt will not ask the above questions if the package is not from the AUR, which means it'll use pacman to install them directly. You can install any package directly by running yay -S &lt;package name&gt;, like in pacman. You can pass multiple package names by separating them with a space\nYou can remove any package by running yay -R &lt;package name&gt;. You can pass multiple package names by separating them with a space\nYou can remove any package along with all it's dependencies (to save space) using yay -Rs &lt;package name&gt;. This may not be possible for all cases due to other packages needing those dependencies.\nYou can run a full update using yay -Syu. Don't put any package names here.\nThis is optional reading material.\nPacman is a very special package manager which allows front-ends to be written for it. You can even use GUI based Pacman front-ends, ditching the need for the command line!

Don't focus on perfection, just have a decent idea of what each letter sounds like.<br>\nYou will need to learn some basic grammar before you can start the soul of the loop.

In short, why worry about why certain grammar is a certain way, when you already understand what you are reading? Of course, this is impossible to do so in the early steps, but just by understanding what certain nouns mean, you can draw a mental relationship between them.<br>\n1: <a rel=\"noopener\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis\" target=\"_self\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"WinnerWind's General Guide to Mastering Any Language","level":1,"id":"WinnerWind's General Guide to Mastering Any Language"},{"heading":"Details","level":1,"id":"Details"},{"heading":"First Steps","level":2,"id":"First_Steps"},{"heading":"The Input Loop.","level":2,"id":"The_Input_Loop."}],"links":["!-resources/loop.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"blog-dump/tutorials/general-loop.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["!-resources/loop.html"],"createdTime":1724296206243,"modifiedTime":1724304987091,"sourceSize":1919,"sourcePath":"Blog Dump/Tutorials/General Loop.md","exportPath":"blog-dump/tutorials/general-loop.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["blog-dump/unfinished-entries.html"],"type":"markdown"},"blog-dump/unfinished-entries.html":{"title":"Unfinished Entries","icon":"","description":"<a data-href=\"Chapter 2\" href=\"blog-dump/tutorials/linux/learn-linux/chapter-2.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Chapter 2</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"General Loop\" href=\"blog-dump/tutorials/general-loop.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">General Loop</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Unfinished Entries","level":1,"id":"Unfinished Entries"}],"links":["blog-dump/tutorials/linux/learn-linux/chapter-2.html","blog-dump/tutorials/general-loop.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"blog-dump/unfinished-entries.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1724422780812,"modifiedTime":1727172449280,"sourceSize":30,"sourcePath":"Blog Dump/Unfinished Entries.md","exportPath":"blog-dump/unfinished-entries.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"music/playlists.html":{"title":"Playlists I like right now","icon":"","description":"If you can't see anything, just give Spotify a moment to load in all the i-frames. more coming soon","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Playlists I like right now","level":1,"id":"Playlists I like right now"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"music/playlists.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1724296206247,"modifiedTime":1722001404759,"sourceSize":1705,"sourcePath":"Music/Playlists.md","exportPath":"music/playlists.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"404.html":{"title":"404","icon":"","description":"No file was found here!\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://winnerwind.github.io\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://winnerwind.github.io\" target=\"_self\">Take me back home</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"404","level":1,"id":"404"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"404.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1724296206247,"modifiedTime":1716222629483,"sourceSize":127,"sourcePath":"404.md","exportPath":"404.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"contact.html":{"title":"Contact me!","icon":"<svg class=\"svg-icon lucide-phone\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M22 16.92v3a2 2 0 0 1-2.18 2 19.79 19.79 0 0 1-8.63-3.07 19.5 19.5 0 0 1-6-6 19.79 19.79 0 0 1-3.07-8.67A2 2 0 0 1 4.11 2h3a2 2 0 0 1 2 1.72 12.84 12.84 0 0 0 .7 2.81 2 2 0 0 1-.45 2.11L8.09 9.91a16 16 0 0 0 6 6l1.27-1.27a2 2 0 0 1 2.11-.45 12.84 12.84 0 0 0 2.81.7A2 2 0 0 1 22 16.92z\"></path></svg>","description":"Discord -&gt; winnerwindE-Mail -&gt; elbowsparse@gmail.com Instagram -&gt; winnerwind0041Reddit -&gt; u/WinnerWindsCompletely fluent and comfortable to talk, write and read English.

I need a dictionary or a translator to fully understand what you might be saying.<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"index\" data-href=\"index\" href=\"index.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Home</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Contact me!","level":1,"id":"Contact me!"},{"heading":"Most Active","level":2,"id":"Most_Active"},{"heading":"Less Active","level":3,"id":"Less_Active"},{"heading":"Language Proficiency","level":1,"id":"Language_Proficiency"},{"heading":"English","level":2,"id":"English"},{"heading":"Hindi","level":2,"id":"Hindi"},{"heading":"Bengali","level":2,"id":"Bengali"},{"heading":"Japanese","level":2,"id":"Japanese"}],"links":["index.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"contact.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1724296206247,"modifiedTime":1723383552343,"sourceSize":810,"sourcePath":"Contact.md","exportPath":"contact.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["blog-dump/tutorials/linux/arch-linux-install.html","blog-dump/tutorials/linux/learn-linux/chapter-1.html","index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"index.html":{"title":"Home","icon":"<svg class=\"svg-icon lucide-warehouse\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M22 8.35V20a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8.35A2 2 0 0 1 3.26 6.5l8-3.2a2 2 0 0 1 1.48 0l8 3.2A2 2 0 0 1 22 8.35Z\"></path><path d=\"M6 18h12\"></path><path d=\"M6 14h12\"></path><rect height=\"12\" width=\"12\" y=\"10\" x=\"6\"></rect></svg>","description":"Hi, I am WinnerWind.
